    faqs: [
      { q: "What's the difference between interior and exterior waterproofing?", a: "Interior systems manage water that reaches your foundation by collecting and redirecting it away from your home. Exterior systems prevent water from reaching the foundation at all. Interior is less disruptive and more cost-effective, while exterior offers maximum protection but requires extensive excavation." },
      { q: "How long does basement waterproofing last?", a: "Quality interior drain tile systems last 25-30 years with minimal maintenance. Sump pumps typically need replacement every 7-10 years. Our systems come with transferable warranties and we provide ongoing maintenance programs." },
      { q: "Can you waterproof a finished basement?", a: "Yes, though it requires careful planning. We can install interior systems with minimal disruption by accessing the perimeter through strategic floor cuts. We work with your schedule to preserve finished areas where possible." },
      { q: "Do I need a sump pump if I have drain tile?", a: "In Minneapolis, yes. Our clay soil, high water table, and spring runoff require active water removal. The drain tile collects water; the sump pump removes it. Battery backup systems are highly recommended for power outages during storms." },
      { q: "Will waterproofing increase my home's value?", a: "Absolutely. A dry, usable basement adds 10-20% to your home's value and makes it much more marketable. Moisture problems are major red flags for buyers and often deal-breakers during inspections." },
      { q: "How much disruption will waterproofing cause?", a: "Interior systems require 2-4 inches of concrete removal around the basement perimeter. Most homes remain livable during installation. We use dust control measures and complete most projects in 2-3 days." }

        { mistake: "Ignoring exterior drainage issues", why: "Interior systems can't handle unlimited water load from poor exterior drainage", consequence: "System overload, premature failure, and continued moisture problems" },
        { mistake: "DIY drain tile installation", why: "Proper slopes, materials, and connection details require professional expertise", consequence: "System failure, standing water, and expensive re-installation" },
        { mistake: "Delaying repairs during dry periods", why: "Water problems appear cyclical but infrastructure damage continues even when basement seems dry", consequence: "Major system failure during next wet period requiring emergency repairs" },
        { mistake: "Choosing lowest-bid contractors", why: "Waterproofing systems are only as good as installation quality and material selection", consequence: "System failure, voided warranties, and complete re-installation costs" }
