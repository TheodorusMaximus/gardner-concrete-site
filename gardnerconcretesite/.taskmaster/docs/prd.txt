Project: Schedule Page UX Refresh

Goals:
- Make the schedule page a callback-first expert scheduling experience
- Improve visual hierarchy: compact hero, form-first, trust grounded
- Accessibility and mobile ergonomics improvements

Key Tasks:
1. Compact hero section; demote call banner to secondary CTA; fix z-index
2. Reframe the form: grouped fields, radios for contact, helper/error text
3. Success state: replace form with confirmation and direct call/our work links
4. Ground trust section as a titled solid card below the form
5. Add small FAQ (3â€“4) below trust; link to /faq
6. Mobile sticky primary action; reduce top padding
7. Copy refinements (titles, button labels, subcopy)
8. Analytics hooks for form view/submit/errors
