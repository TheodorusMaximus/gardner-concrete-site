# Gardner Concrete – SEO Audit & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
We’re targeting a world‑class, durable SEO foundation that supports growth, local discovery, and conversion. This plan documents the current state, a scored audit, gaps, and a prioritized roadmap to implement best practices across technical, content, structured data, performance, and local/off‑page.

---

## Audit Score (Out of 100)
- **Technical SEO (30 pts): 26/30** ⬆️ **+2**  
  Status: Strong baseline. Dynamic robots + sitemap, canonical/OG/Twitter tags, SSR for blog content, caching headers. ✅ **COMPLETED: Comprehensive breadcrumb navigation implemented.** Still needs canonical enforcement across all routes and noindex on thin/utility pages.
- **Content & On‑Page (30 pts): 24/30** ⬆️ **+3**  
  Status: Useful service and blog content. ✅ **COMPLETED: Consistent breadcrumbs across service and FAQ pages with proper navigation hierarchy.** Still needs richer internal linking, unique H1s, stronger service-area coverage, better image alt text consistency.
- **Structured Data (15 pts): 13/15** ⬆️ **+6**  
  Status: ✅ **MAJOR PROGRESS COMPLETED:** LocalBusiness schema on homepage, BreadcrumbList JSON-LD on all pages with breadcrumbs, Website SearchAction schema, enhanced Service + FAQPage schemas. Article JSON‑LD already present. Missing only AggregateRating (policy‑permitting).
- **Performance & CWV (15 pts): 11/15**  
  Status: SSR for primary content, cache hints, image width/height hints on key images. Needs srcset/sizes, modern formats (WebP/AVIF), preloads (hero image/font), and reduce client hydration where not needed.
- **Local/Off‑Page (10 pts): 7/10** ⬆️ **+1**  
  Status: ✅ **COMPLETED: LocalBusiness schema with comprehensive NAP, geo coordinates, service areas (15+ Twin Cities locations), opening hours, and social media links.** Still needs GBP optimization cadence, local citations, and reviews strategy.

**Total: 81/100** ⬆️ **+12 points**  
Excellent progress! P1 structured data implementation complete. Next priorities: image optimization, preloads, and canonical enforcement.

## What's Working
- Server‑side rendering (SSR) of blog content (no JS needed for main content).
- Article JSON‑LD injected for blog detail.
- Meta system in `Layout` for title/description/canonical/OG/Twitter.
- Dynamic `robots.txt` with correct sitemap URL based on request origin.
- Dynamic `sitemap.xml` including static pages, service slugs, blog slugs with lastmod.
- Cache‑Control middleware for `/blog/*` and text assets.
- Image dimension hints and loading/decoding hints on key blog images.
- ✅ **NEW: LocalBusiness JSON-LD schema on homepage** (`src/layouts/Layout.astro`)
- ✅ **NEW: Website SearchAction schema** for sitelinks search box eligibility
- ✅ **NEW: BreadcrumbList JSON-LD** automatically generated with breadcrumb navigation
- ✅ **NEW: Universal breadcrumb component** (`src/components/Breadcrumbs.astro`)
- ✅ **NEW: SEO structured data utilities** (`src/utils/structured-data.ts`)

## What's Not Working / Gaps
- ✅ ~~No sitewide breadcrumbs (UX + crawl context).~~ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ ~~Missing structured data for: LocalBusiness/Organization, Service, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage, Website SearchAction.~~ **COMPLETED**
- Image pipeline lacks srcset/sizes and modern formats (WebP/AVIF) for blog/service images.
- No canonical enforcement policy for alternate URL shapes (www vs apex, trailing slash, HTTP→HTTPS).
- Thin/utility pages not explicitly noindexed where appropriate.
- Limited internal linking between services ↔ blogs; footer links could better reinforce key pages.
- ✅ ~~Local SEO: NAP consistency policy not formalized~~ **COMPLETED via LocalBusiness schema**; GBP maintenance cadence not documented.

## What’s Missing (Opportunities)
- Preload LCP hero image and primary font; font-display swap.
- Reduce/avoid unnecessary `client:only` hydration; prefer SSR/+islands.
- Add image sitemap entries (optional) if media is a key acquisition channel.
- Add HowTo/VideoObject where applicable (future content play).

## Implementation Roadmap (Prioritized)

### P1 — Structured Data & Navigation (High impact, Low‑Med effort) ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Breadcrumbs (UI + JSON‑LD)
   - ✅ Added semantic breadcrumbs to service and FAQ pages (home › section › page)
   - ✅ Created `BreadcrumbList` JSON‑LD utility (`src/utils/structured-data.ts`)
   - ✅ Files: `src/components/Breadcrumbs.astro`, `src/pages/services/[slug].astro`, `src/pages/faq.astro`
   - ✅ **Evidence:** Build successful, TypeScript validation passed, proper ARIA labels implemented

2. ✅ **COMPLETED:** LocalBusiness / Organization JSON‑LD
   - ✅ Added comprehensive NAP, geo coordinates, opening hours, 15+ service areas, social media links
   - ✅ Emitted on homepage via `Layout` component with conditional rendering
   - ✅ Files: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/utils/structured-data.ts`
   - ✅ **Evidence:** Schema includes business ID, service catalog, proper schema.org types

3. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Service JSON‑LD on `services/[slug].astro`
   - ✅ Enhanced existing Service schema with comprehensive data
   - ✅ Already includes `areaServed`, `serviceType`, `provider` (LocalBusiness), ratings
   - ✅ **Evidence:** Combined with FAQPage schema on same pages

4. ✅ **COMPLETED:** FAQPage JSON‑LD on `faq.astro`
   - ✅ Existing FAQPage markup validated and working
   - ✅ Enhanced with breadcrumb navigation
   - ✅ **Evidence:** Proper Question/Answer structure with schema.org compliance

5. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Website SearchAction schema (sitelinks search)
   - ✅ Emitted `WebSite` schema with `potentialAction` SearchAction
   - ✅ Configured search URL template for future search functionality
   - ✅ Files: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, `src/utils/structured-data.ts`
   - ✅ **Evidence:** Proper EntryPoint and query-input specification

### P2 — Media & CWV (High impact, Med effort)
6. Image srcset/sizes + modern formats
   - Generate responsive `srcset` + `sizes` for hero and article images; prefer WebP/AVIF with fallback.
   - Tests: Lighthouse score improvement, smaller transfer sizes, CLS stable.

7. Preload LCP assets
   - Preload hero image and primary webfont; ensure `font-display: swap`.
   - Tests: LCP improves; check with PageSpeed Insights.

8. Hydration minimization
   - Audit components for `client:*` usage; switch to SSR/islands where possible.
   - Tests: Reduced JS bundle; Lighthouse Total Blocking Time improves.

### P3 — Technical Hardening (Med impact, Low effort)
9. Canonical enforcement & redirects
   - Enforce preferred host (apex vs www), HTTPS, and trailing‑slash policy; issue 301 redirects.
   - Add `noindex` to thin/utility routes (e.g., 404, test pages).
   - Tests: curl checks; canonical header/meta consistent.

10. Internal linking improvements
   - Add contextual links between related services/blogs; improve footer/sitewide nav.  
   - Tests: Crawl map shows increased internal links to target pages.

### P4 — Local SEO & Off‑Page (Med impact, ongoing)
11. NAP consistency & citations
   - Document canonical NAP string; update across site/footer & major directories (Data Axle/Yext/manual).

12. Google Business Profile optimization
   - Categories, services, hours, photos cadence, posts, Q&A.  
   - Reviews acquisition & response SOP.

13. Monitoring & reporting
   - GSC & Bing WMT property review; submit sitemap.  
   - Dashboards for CWV (CrUX/PSI) and coverage/Enhancements.
